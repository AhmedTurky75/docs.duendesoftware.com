# Samples

We have a collection of runnable samples that show how to use IdentityServer and configure client applications in a variety of scenarios. Most of the samples include both their own IdentityServer implementation and the
clients and APIs needed to demonstrate the illustrated functionality. The "Basics" samples use a [shared IdentityServer implementation]({{< param samples_base >}}/Basics/IdentityServer), and some of the BFF samples use our public [demo instance of IdentityServer](https://demo.duendesoftware.com/).

{{%children style="li" /%}}

The source code for the samples is in our samples [repository]({{< param samples_base >}}).

Feel free to open a new BFF or IdentityServer [issue ](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/Support/issues/new/choose) if you are looking for a particular sample and can't find it here.
