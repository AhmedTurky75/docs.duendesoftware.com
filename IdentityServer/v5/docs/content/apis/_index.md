# Protecting APIs

Duende IdentityServer issues tokens for accessing resources.

These resources are very often HTTP-based APIs, but could be also other "invokable" functionality like messaging endpoints, gRPC services or even good old XML Web Services. See the [issuing tokens]({{< ref "/tokens" >}}) section on more information on access tokens and how to request them.
